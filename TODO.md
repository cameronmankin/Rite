# TODO
## Layout
- Make card back png for TTS
- Concatenate Type and Subtype into one layout slot.
- Scale font size / kerning based on character count for text fields
- Insight icon too busy, obscures numbers (resolvable with offset, typeface, changing icon...)
## Cards
- Abilities for cult leaders
- Locations cards (vision design and what zone they enter play from)
- Flash blocker
- Mechanics matrix
## Playtest
- "What if you never paid a favor cost?"
- Update rules text such that we could give it to a prospective playtester and let them review it.
